# Running the application on BlueCloud Infrastructure

The app is a component of the GlobalFisheriesAtlas Virtual Research Environment (VRE), which includes an RStudio server for developers and a Shiny proxy server for hosting applications. The VRE aims to simplify data exploration through analytical indicators without the need for delving into source code.

# Running the application outside the BlueCloud Infrastructure

## Prerequisites

A connection to a populated database with Global Tuna Atlas data and metadata is required. Instructions for database creation or connection setup are available on the project's GitHub page. The connection identifiers must be provided through a connection_tunaatlas_inv.txt file copied in the repository (or copied in the docker if using the docker image).

## Running from RStudio

Launch the `app.R` file in RStudio. The app uses the `renv` package for package management. Ensure compatibility with the R version specified in the lockfile to avoid loading errors.

## Running with Docker

### Pull and Run

```sh

docker pull ghcr.io/firms-gta/tunaatlas_pie_map_shiny:latest
docker run -p 4848:3838 -v /path/to/your/connection_tunaatlas_inv.txt:connection_tunaatlas_inv.txt ghcr.io/firms-gta/tunaatlas_pie_map_shiny_cwp_database:latdocker image prune

```
