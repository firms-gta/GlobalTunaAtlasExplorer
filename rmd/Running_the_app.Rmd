# Running the application on BlueCloud Infrastructure

The app is a component of the GlobalFisheriesAtlas Virtual Research Environment (VRE), which includes an RStudio server for developers and a Shiny proxy server for hosting applications. The VRE aims to simplify data exploration through analytical indicators without the need for delving into source code.

# Running the application outside the BlueCloud Infrastructure

## Prerequisites

A populated database with Global Tuna Atlas data and metadata is required. Instructions for database creation or connection setup are available on the project's GitHub page.

## Running from RStudio

Launch the `app.R` file in RStudio. The app uses the `renv` package for package management. Ensure compatibility with the R version specified in the lockfile to avoid loading errors.

## Running with Docker
