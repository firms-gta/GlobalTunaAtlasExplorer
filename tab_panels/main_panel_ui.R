                        Shiny apps have been set up to help newcomers to explore easily the data by using the set of indicators generated by analysis code. Users of shiny apps interested in the code will rather use the related jupyternotebooks than shinyp apps source code.

                        These Shiny apps have been developped and executed in the Fisheries Atlas VRE which contains a RStudio server for developpers and a shiny proxy server to host these apps.
